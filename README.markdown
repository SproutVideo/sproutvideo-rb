# SproutVideo
Use this gem to interact with the [SproutVideo API](http://sproutvideo.com/docs/api.html)

# Getting Started

First, you'll need to install the gem

    gem install sproutvideo-rb

The first thing you'll need to interact with the SproutVideo API is your API key. You can use your API key in one of two ways. The first and easiest is to set it and forget it on the Sproutvideo module like so:

```ruby
Sproutvideo.api_key = 'abcd1234'
```

Alternatively, you can use an environment variable:

```ruby
ENV['SPROUTVIDEO_API_KEY'] = 'abcd1234'
```

# Videos
The following methods are available: `list`, `create`, `details`, `update`, `upload_poster_frame`,`destroy`.

## list
By default the videos listing is paginated with 25 videos per page and sorted by upload date in ascending order.
You can pass two parameters to control the paging: `page` and `per_page`.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.list
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:per_page => 10)
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:per_page => 10, :page => 2)
```

You can control sorting order by `order_by` and `order_dir` parameter.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:order_by => "created_at")
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:order_by => "updated_at")
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:order_by => "title", :order_dir => "asc")
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:order_by => "duration", :order_dir => "desc")
```

You can also pass `tag_id`, `tag_name`, `privacy` and `state` parameters to restrict result.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:tag_id => 'a323d32')
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:tag_name => 'funny cat videos')
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:privacy => 2)
Sproutvideo::Video.list(:state => "processing")
```

Values of `privacy` is listed at [Video Privacy](http://sproutvideo.com/docs/api.html#VideoPrivacy) section.
Values of `state` is listed at [Video States](http://sproutvideo.com/docs/api.html#VideoStates) section.

## details
The string passed to details is the ID of a SproutVideo video.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.details('abc123')
```

## create
The most basic upload you can perform is to just pass the path to the video file to the method. The title of the video will default to the name of the file.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.create('/path/to/video.mp4')
```

You can set the title as well as many other parameters by passing them as a hash

 ```ruby
 Sproutvideo::Video.create('/path/to/video.mp4',
   :title => 'My Awesome Video',
   :description => 'This video is great',
   :privacy => 2)
```

You can also apply any number of tags to the new upload by passing their ids along:

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.create('/path/to/video.mp4',
  :tags => ['ec61', 'abc123'])
```

You can also create or add tags on the fly by passing in tag names:

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.create('/path/to/video.mp4',
  :tag_names => ['Tag One', 'Tag Two'])
```

You can also specify a webhook url. We'll send an HTTP POST with the video json when the video has finished processing or if there was an error during processing:

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.create('/path/to/video.mp4',
  :notification_url => 'http://example.com/webhook_url')
```

## update
 The first parameter is the id of the video you wish to edit. The second parameter is a hash of attributes to update on the video.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.update('abc123', :title => 'Updated Title')
```

## Replace a video
The first parameter is the id of the video you wish to replace. The second parameter is the local path to the video file.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.replace('abc123', '/path/to/video.mp4')
```

## Dealing with tags
To add a tag to a video, make sure to include all of the tags currently associated with the video. For instance if the video already has tags with the ids "abc" and "123" and you want to add a tag with the id "def" do pass "abc", "123" and "def" to the update method.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.update('abc123',
  :tags => ["abc", "123", "def"])
```

If you want to remove a tag from a video, remove the tag from the list of tags on the video but make sure to include all of the tags you wish to keep. For instance, if you now want to remove the tag with id "123" from the example above, pass in "abc" and "def"

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.update("abc123",
  :tags => ["abc","def"])
```

You can remove all of the tags from a video by just passing an empty array as the tags parameter.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.update('abc123', :tags => [])
```
## Upload poster frame
You can upload a custom poster frame for a video by calling the upload_poster_frame method. The first parameter is the id of the video for wish you'd like the poster frame to be associated and the second parameter is the path to the image file.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.upload_poster_frame('abc123', '/path/to/image.jpg')
```

## destroy
Pass in the id of the video you wish to delete.

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.destroy('abc123')
```

## Signed Embed Codes
You can use this convenience method to sign an embed code. It will return the embed code URL which can be used to build an iframe embed code.
`Sproutvideo::Video.signed_embed_code(video_id, security_token, query_parameters, expiration_time, protocol)`

### Parameters
video_id - _String_ (_Required_)
: The id of the video for which you're generating the signed embed code

security_token - _String_ (_Required_)
: The security token of the video for which you're generatingn the signed embed code

query_parameteres - _Hash_ (_Optional_)
: A hash of query parameters to be passed to the embed code. Example: `{'type' => 'hd', 'autoplay' => true}`

expiration_time - _Integer_ (_Optional_)
: The number of seconds from the Epoc that this signed embed code should expire. This defaults to 5 minutes from the time the signed embed code was generated.

protocol - _String_ (_Optional_)
: `http` or `https`. Defaults to `http`

### Examples
```ruby
Sproutvideo::Video.signed_embed_code('abc123','def456') #sign a base embed code with no other options
Sproutvideo::Video.signed_embed_code('abc123','def456', {'type' => 'hd'}) #set parameters for the embed code such as changing the default video type to HD
Sproutvideo::Video.signed_embed_code('abc123','def456', {}, 1368127991) #set a specific expiration time for the signed embed code. (By default the expiration time is set to 5 minutes from the time the signed embed code was generated).
Sproutvideo::Video.signed_embed_code('abc123','def456', {}, nil, 'https') #Use https instead of http
```
# Upload Tokens
The following methods are available: `create`

## Create
```ruby
Sproutvideo::UploadToken.create
Sproutvideo::UploadToken.create(:return_url => 'http://example.com')
Sproutvideo::UploadToken.create(:return_url => 'http://example.com', :seconds_valid => 3600)
```

# Tags

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Tag.list
Sproutvideo::Tag.list(:per_page => 10)
Sproutvideo::Tag.list(:per_page => 10, :page => 2)
```

## create

If you do not pass in a `parent_id` only the folders within the root folder will be returned. To get the folders in a specific folder, make sure to pass in that folder's id using the `parent_id` parameter.
```ruby
Sproutvideo::Folder.list
Sproutvideo::Folder.last(:per_page => 10)
Sproutvideo::Folder.last(:per_page => 10, :page => 2)
Sproutvideo::Folder.last(:parent_id => 'def456')
```

## create
Creating a folder without a `parent_id` will place that folder in the root folder. Passing in a `parent_id` will place the newly created folder in the folder specified by `parent_id`.

```ruby
# folder is created in the root folder.
Sproutvideo::Folder.create(:name => 'New Folder')

```

## delete
By default, when deleting a folder, all of the contents of that folder (videos and folders), will be moved the root folder to prevent unintended data loss. If you wish to actually delete all of the content of a folder, make sure to pass in `delete_all` as true.

```ruby
# delete the folder and move it's contents to the root folder

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Playlist.update('abc123',
  :videos => ["abc", "123", "def"])
```

If you want to remove a video from a playlist, remove the video from the list of videos in the playlist but make sure to include all of the videos you wish to keep. For instance, if you now want to remove the video with id "123" from the example above, pass in "abc" and "def"

```ruby
Sproutvideo::Playlist.update("abc123",
